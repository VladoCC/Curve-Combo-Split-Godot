# Combine and split curves in Godot

This project contains code that allows you to split and/or combines Curves (both 2D and 3D) in Godot. This might be helpful for creating procedural and player-defined paths for your games.   
There are also `CombinedPath` scripts included, which allow you to combine parts of curves into one single path through the editor. **Beware that this process is not quite optimized**.
